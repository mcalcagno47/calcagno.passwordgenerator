# Password Generator, by Mark Calcagno

## Description
This website allows for a user to generate a password between 8 and 128 characters.  The user will decide 
what types of characters to allow into the password, which will result in a string of random characters that 
the user can copy and utilize as a password.

## Installation
The project runs in the browser, and does not require an installation

## Usage
As described earlier, the user will decide what types of characters to allow into the password, choosing 
between lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols.  Once the decisions have been logged, the script creates 
a string of random characters that the user can copy and utilize as a password.
